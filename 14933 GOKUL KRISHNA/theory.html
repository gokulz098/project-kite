                        Information theory is the mathematical study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information.<br>
                         The field was originally established by the works of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, in the 1920s, and Claude <br>
                         Shannon in the 1940s.: vii  The field, in applied mathematics, is at the intersection of probability theory, <br>
                         statistics, computer science, statistical mechanics, information engineering, and electrical engineering.<br>
                         A key measure in information theory is entropy. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in<br>
                          the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of<br>
                           a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy, less uncertainty)<br> 
                           than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures<br>
                            in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important <br>
                            sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory<br> 
                            and information-theoretic security.Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding/data <br>
                            compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has <br>
                            been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility<br>
                             of mobile phones and the development of the Internet. The theory has also found applications in other areas,<br>
                              including statistical inference, cryptography, neurobiology perception, linguistics, the evolution and function<br> 
                              of molecular codes (bioinformatics), thermal physics, molecular dynamics, quantum computing, black holes,<br>
                               information retrieval, intelligence gathering, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, anomaly detection<br>
                                and even art creation.

                        Interest in the multiverse theory, suggesting that our universe is just one of many, spiked following the release of the<br>
                         movie "Everything Everywhere All At Once." The film follows Evelyn Wang on her journey to connect with versions of herself <br>
                         in parallel universes to ultimately stop the destruction of the multiverse. The multiverse idea has long been an inspiration <br>
                         for science fiction writers. But does it have any basis in science? And if so, is it a concept we could ever test experimentally?.<br>
                         That's the topic of the third episode of our podcast Great Mysteries of Physics—hosted by me, Miriam Frankel, science editor at The <br>
                         Conversation, and supported by FQxI, the Foundational Questions Institute."One way to think of a multiverse is just to say, 'Well, <br>
                         the universe might be really, really big—much bigger than our observable universe—and so there could be other regions of the universe<br>
                          that are far beyond our horizon that have different things happening in them'," explains Katie Mack, Hawking chair in cosmology and science <br>
                          communication at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. "And I think that idea is totally well accepted in cosmology." <br>
                          The idea that there could be other parts of the cosmos with different physical laws, processes and histories is hard to ignore. And the concept <br>
                          is consistent with the theories of quantum mechanics, which governs the micro-world of atoms and particles, string theory (an attempt at a theory<br>
                           of everything)—and also with cosmic inflation, which says the infant universe blew up hugely in size during a brief growth spurt, and then continued<br>
                            to grow at a less frantic pace. These theories each give rise to their own version of the multiverse theory.

                            In theoretical physics, the matrix theory is a quantum mechanical model proposed in 1997 by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, <br>
                            Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind; it is also known as BFSS matrix model, after the authors' initials.[This theory<br> 
                            describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, <br>
                            that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them <br>
                            to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a<br>
                             prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple<br>
                              setting. The BFSS matrix model is also considered the worldvolume theory of a large number of D0-branes in Type IIA string theory.<br>
                              n geometry, it is often useful to introduce coordinates. For example, in order to study the geometry of the Euclidean plane, one<br>
                               defines the coordinates x and y as the distances between any point in the plane and a pair of axes. In ordinary geometry, the coordinates<br>
                                of a point are numbers, so they can be multiplied, and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication. <br>
                                That is, xy = yx. This property of multiplication is known as the commutative law, and this relationship between geometry and the<br>
                                 commutative algebra of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry.Noncommutative geometry is a branch of <br>
                                 mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation. Rather than working with ordinary numbers, one considers some similar objects, <br>
                                 such as matrices, whose multiplication does not satisfy the commutative law (that is, objects for which xy is not necessarily equal to yx).<br>
                                  One imagines that these noncommuting objects are coordinates on some more general notion of "space" and proves theorems about these<br>
                                   generalized spaces by exploiting the analogy with ordinary geometry. In a paper from 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and<br>
                                    Albert Schwarz showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a noncommutative quantum field theory, a <br>
                                    special kind of physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established<br>
                                     a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery <br>
                                     of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.
